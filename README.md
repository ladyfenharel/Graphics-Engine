# CS-330 Final Project

## How do I approach designing software?
I start by identifying the problem, breaking it down into manageable pieces, and creating a plan that integrates user needs with technical feasibility. Iteration is key, ensuring I continuously refine my design to meet requirements and improve functionality.

## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project sharpened my skills in user-centered design, making sure the software’s interface and flow are intuitive. I also honed my ability to balance scalability with efficiency and maintainability.

## What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed an agile design process, starting with wireframes and prototypes, gathering feedback, and iterating. This allowed me to remain flexible and responsive to changes throughout the project.

## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
By focusing on user feedback early and iterating quickly, I can create more adaptable designs. This approach will be valuable in future projects where responsiveness and flexibility are essential.

## How do I approach developing programs?
I approach development by breaking the problem into smaller, testable parts and writing clean, modular code. I prioritize clarity and functionality, testing each component as I build.

## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I used object-oriented programming and modular design to manage the complexity of the 3D scene. Optimizing performance was key, using efficient algorithms for rendering and collision detection.

## How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was crucial—by testing early and often, I was able to identify issues and refine my approach. Each round of feedback and testing informed my next steps, ensuring the final product was robust and effective.

## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
I’ve become more focused on modularity, debugging early, and writing more efficient code. As I progressed, I also started planning better and incorporating more feedback into each milestone, which helped me refine the overall design.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science provides the tools to bring ideas to life, whether through problem-solving, innovation, or automation. It helps me develop the technical skills to create impactful solutions that align with my personal and professional goals.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
They enhance my understanding of how to represent complex data visually, allowing me to communicate abstract concepts clearly. These skills are invaluable for tackling complex problems and presenting findings effectively in future studies.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
These tools will help me create more engaging, data-driven solutions in my future career. Visualizing data and concepts makes it easier to communicate insights, which is crucial for making informed decisions and solving real-world challenges.
